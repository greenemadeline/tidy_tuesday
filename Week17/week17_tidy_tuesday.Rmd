This week for TidyTuesday, I practiced a lot of skills that I already had and tried to understand them more. One skill I did learn was about scale_x_continuous and being able to change the labels for the currency provided in the data. Originally when plotting, the data would be with exponents, and I did not want a super long number there either so this was a great new skill to learn. I also tried a different form of point and added a background image as well. Lastly, I added a vline to separate the outliers of the data from the overall data to see the top 9 fines from the gdpr.
